# MLPR2_GAN
university course experiments

To experiment with different GAN techniques on [Generative Dog Images](https://www.kaggle.com/c/generative-dog-images/overview) challenge.

1. DCGAN
    - Buids on top of [Keras.io](https://keras.io/examples/generative/dcgan_overriding_train_step/) example 
    - This needs some organization on callbacks. Will be updated soon.
    1. extract dataset to all-dogs folder 
    2. Execute cells in `dcgan.ipynb` notebook.
